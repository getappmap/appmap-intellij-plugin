AppMap is a free and open source visualization tool that allows you to see how your software works as it’s running.
You can use AppMaps to onboard to unfamiliar code, debug hard-to-fix issues, review code behavior changes before
making a commit, and improve the quality of code reviews.

AppMap works best for mapping web services and web applications. [Join our community](https://appmap.io/community/)
 to help us expand support for more types of applications and frameworks!

## Requirements

**2021.1** and newer JetBrains IDEs are required to use this plugin.

Currently, AppMap supports Spring, Express.js, Django, Flask and Rails projects. The most up-to-date list of frameworks and languages we support is
[here](https://appmap.io/docs/integrations.html). 

To start making AppMaps, you’ll need to install and configure the AppMap client agent for your project.
Then, you’ll make AppMaps by running your app - either by
[running test cases](https://appmap.io/docs/recording-methods.html#recording-test-cases), or by
[recording a short interaction with your app](https://appmap.io/docs/reference/remote-recording.html).

[Here's a convenient quickstart guide](https://appmap.io/docs/quickstart/) that walks you through the AppMap install flow.

## Summary of features

Summary of Features:
- Interactive maps of code’s behavior, so you can see what code is really doing as it runs, including: 
    - Dependency maps that display how your app’s components are all connected, so you can quickly see how changes affect the big picture
    - Trace diagrams that show details about how a feature works, so you can find optimization opportunities and investigate tricky bugs
    - SQL query data, so you can see exactly what’s happening between your code and the database  
    - Web services data, so you can see what message your app received and how it responded
    - Labels that identify the key functions in source code, so you can easily find critical code events and ensure they’re configured and used properly
